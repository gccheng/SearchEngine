The HTML Web interface is stored in the index.html file.
The CGI script is in cgi-bin/Query.cgi.

The assumption is that there is a search engine that receives
as input a query string, and outputs a list of documents. The 
behaviour of such a search engine is simulated by the 
mySearchEngine program, which simply outputs a list of document
names.

To adapt this to your own search engine, you might need to change
some variable names in the cgi-bin/Query.cgi program. See the
top of the file for the variables that need to be updated.
